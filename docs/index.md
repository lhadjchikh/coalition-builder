## Architecture

- **Backend**: Django API with PostgreSQL/PostGIS
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and styled-components
- **SSR**: Next.js for SEO optimization (optional)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform-managed AWS deployment

### Frontend Architecture

Coalition Builder uses a flexible frontend architecture that supports both traditional SPA deployment and optional server-side rendering (SSR).

#### How the Frontend Works

The `/frontend` directory contains a React application built with Webpack that serves as the primary user interface. This single codebase works in two different deployment modes:

**Without SSR (Default Mode):**

1. React app is built into static files (JS/CSS with cache-busting hashes)
2. Django serves these files through a template (`index.html`)
3. Django's `home` view reads `asset-manifest.json` to inject correct file paths
4. React takes over as a single-page application in the browser
5. API calls go to Django backend via `/api/*` routes

**With SSR (Optional Mode):**

1. Next.js handles server-side rendering for better SEO
2. Django serves only API endpoints (`/api/*`, `/admin/*`)
3. nginx routes frontend requests (`/*`) to Next.js instead of Django
4. Next.js imports and renders the same React components from `/frontend/src/components/`
5. Shared error handling logic ensures consistent behavior in both modes

#### Request Routing

**SSR Disabled:**

```
/* ‚Üí Django home view ‚Üí React SPA
/api/* ‚Üí Django API
/admin/* ‚Üí Django Admin
```

**SSR Enabled:**

```
/* ‚Üí Next.js SSR
/api/* ‚Üí Django API
/admin/* ‚Üí Django Admin
```

#### Key Benefits

- **Single Frontend Codebase**: Write once, deploy with or without SSR
- **Django Integration**: Static files served through Django's static system
- **Asset Management**: Automatic cache-busting via asset manifest
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Choose complexity vs. performance trade-offs
- **Fallback Strategy**: Can disable SSR without losing frontend functionality

This architecture allows organizations to start simple (Django + React SPA) and add SSR later for improved SEO without rewriting their frontend code.
