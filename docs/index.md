## Architecture

### Serverless Architecture (Current)

- **Backend**: Django API on AWS Lambda (via Zappa)
- **Frontend**: Next.js on Vercel Edge Network
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS (RDS)
- **Rate Limiting**: DynamoDB (serverless)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform-managed AWS resources
- **Cost**: ~$39/month (46% reduction from ECS)

### Legacy Architecture (Deprecated)

- **Backend**: Django API on ECS Fargate
- **Frontend**: Next.js on ECS with SSR
- **Infrastructure**: ALB + ECS + NAT Gateway
- **Cost**: ~$73/month

### Frontend Architecture

Coalition Builder uses a Next.js-based frontend architecture with server-side rendering for optimal SEO and performance.

#### How the Frontend Works

The `/frontend` directory contains a Next.js application that serves as the primary user interface:

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: Next.js pre-renders pages on the server for better SEO
2. **API Integration**: Frontend fetches data from Django backend via `/api/*` routes
3. **Optimized Performance**: Automatic code splitting and optimized bundle sizes
4. **React Components**: Modern React with TypeScript for type safety
5. **Styled Components**: CSS-in-JS for component-level styling

#### Request Routing

```
/* ‚Üí Next.js Frontend (SSR)
/api/* ‚Üí Django API
/admin/* ‚Üí Django Admin
/static/* ‚Üí Django Static Files
```

#### Key Benefits

- **SEO Optimized**: Server-side rendering ensures search engines can index content
- **Fast Initial Load**: Pre-rendered HTML for instant page display
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support across the application
- **Modern Stack**: Latest React and Next.js features
- **Production Ready**: Serverless deployment with Lambda and Vercel
