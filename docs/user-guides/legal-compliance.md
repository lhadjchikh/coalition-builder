# Legal Compliance Guide

This guide covers how to configure and manage legal compliance features in Coalition Builder, including Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and GDPR-compliant cookie consent.

## Overview

Coalition Builder includes comprehensive legal compliance features to help protect your organization from liability and meet regulatory requirements like GDPR and CCPA.

### Key Features

- **Terms of Use Management**: Version-controlled legal documents with acceptance tracking
- **Privacy Policy**: Configurable privacy documentation for user transparency
- **Cookie Consent**: GDPR-compliant cookie consent management with vanilla-cookieconsent
- **Acceptance Audit Trail**: Track when and how users accept legal terms

## Terms of Use Configuration

### Creating Legal Documents

1. **Access Django Admin**: Navigate to `/admin/` and log in with admin credentials
2. **Go to Legal Documents**: Click on "Legal Documents" under the "Legal" section
3. **Add New Document**: Click "Add Legal Document"

### Document Fields

- **Document Type**: Choose from "Terms of Use", "Privacy Policy", "Cookie Policy", or "Acceptable Use Policy"
- **Title**: Display title for the document
- **Content**: Full legal text (HTML formatting supported)
- **Version**: Version identifier (e.g., "1.0", "2024-01-01")
- **Is Active**: Only one document per type can be active at a time
- **Effective Date**: When this version becomes effective

### Example Fixture Data

Use the provided example fixtures to get started:

```bash
# Load example Terms of Use
python manage.py loaddata sample_data/example_legal_terms_of_use.json

# Load example Privacy Policy
python manage.py loaddata sample_data/example_legal_privacy_policy.json
```

### Customizing Legal Content

1. Copy the example fixtures from `sample_data/` directory
2. Modify the content to match your organization's needs
3. Update contact information, addresses, and legal requirements
4. Load your customized fixtures into the database

## Terms Acceptance Tracking

### How It Works

When users submit endorsements with terms acceptance:

- **Audit Trail**: Records IP address, user agent, and timestamp
- **Document Version**: Links to specific version of terms accepted
- **Unique Token**: Each acceptance gets a unique identifier
- **Immutable Records**: Acceptance records cannot be modified after creation

### Viewing Acceptance Records

1. Go to Django Admin â†’ "Terms Acceptances"
2. View detailed acceptance history with stakeholder information
3. Filter by date, document type, or endorsement
4. Export records for legal compliance audits

## Cookie Consent Management

### GDPR Compliance

Coalition Builder uses vanilla-cookieconsent for client-side cookie management:

- **Necessary Cookies**: Always enabled (session, security, preferences)
- **Analytics Cookies**: Optional, user-controlled
- **Consent Banner**: Appears on first visit
- **Preference Center**: Users can modify choices anytime

### Cookie Categories

#### Strictly Necessary

- Session management
- CSRF protection
- User preferences
- Authentication tokens

#### Analytics (Optional)

- Website usage statistics
- Performance monitoring
- User behavior analysis

### Configuration

Cookie consent is automatically configured with sensible defaults. The banner includes:

- Clear description of cookie usage
- Accept/Reject options
- Link to Privacy Policy
- Preferences management

## Privacy Policy Management

### Required Sections

Ensure your privacy policy covers:

- **Data Collection**: What personal data you collect
- **Usage Purpose**: Why you collect and process data
- **Data Sharing**: If and how data is shared with third parties
- **User Rights**: How users can access, modify, or delete their data
- **Contact Information**: How to reach your privacy officer

### Integration Points

Privacy policy is automatically linked from:

- Footer on all SSR pages
- Cookie consent banner
- Terms of Use references
- Endorsement form disclosures

## Legal Page Management

### Automatic Page Generation

Legal documents are automatically available at:

- `/terms` - Active Terms of Use
- `/privacy` - Active Privacy Policy

### Error Handling

If no active document exists:

- Returns 404 with helpful error message
- Suggests contacting administration
- Maintains site functionality

### Content Security

All legal document content is:

- **Sanitized**: HTML content is cleaned to prevent XSS
- **Versioned**: Historical versions are preserved
- **Auditable**: Creation and modification tracking

## API Integration

### Available Endpoints

- `GET /api/legal/terms/` - Current Terms of Use
- `GET /api/legal/privacy/` - Current Privacy Policy
- `GET /api/legal/documents/` - List all active documents

### Response Format

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Terms of Use",
  "content": "<h1>Terms of Use</h1>...",
  "version": "1.0",
  "effective_date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "document_type": "terms"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Document Management

1. **Version Control**: Always increment version numbers when making changes
2. **Effective Dates**: Set future effective dates for major changes
3. **Content Review**: Have legal counsel review all documents
4. **Regular Updates**: Review and update annually or as regulations change

### Compliance Monitoring

1. **Acceptance Tracking**: Regularly audit terms acceptance records
2. **Cookie Compliance**: Monitor cookie usage and user preferences
3. **Privacy Requests**: Implement processes for data subject requests
4. **Documentation**: Maintain records of all legal document changes

### User Experience

1. **Clear Language**: Use plain language where possible
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure documents are screen reader friendly
3. **Mobile Friendly**: Test legal pages on mobile devices
4. **Easy Navigation**: Provide clear links and breadcrumbs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Legal Documents Displayed**

- Check that documents are marked as "active"
- Verify effective dates are not in the future
- Ensure database migrations have run

**Cookie Consent Not Appearing**

- Check browser developer tools for JavaScript errors
